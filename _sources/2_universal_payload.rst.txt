.. _overview:

Overview
----------

   Most modern platforms rely on system firmware to initialize the
   hardware and launch an Operating System (OS). The system firmware is
   responsible for initializing the platform hardware including CPU and
   other silicon functional blocks, detecting and initializing the
   memory subsystem, boot media initialization and setting up hardware
   abstractions for use by the operating systems.

   While newer architectural enhancements such as PCI, PCIe, and USB 
   are developed at an industrial scale, there are vendor specific
   micro-architectural enhancements that happens at a much faster pace.
   Silicon vendors differentiate through these microarchitectural
   enhancements and these features are often considered intellectual
   property and rely on system specific firmware initialization. The
   system firmware thus provides the necessary abstraction and allows a
   generic operating system to run on different platform configurations
   and technologies without needing any changes to the operating system
   itself.

   A design methodology of viewing system firmware functionality as made
   up of two distinct phases (**initialization** and **OS boot logic**)
   is gaining traction resulting in newer implementations of system
   firmware. This approach calls for modular phases with an
   initialization phase (bootloader) which completes the system
   initialization and gets the hardware to a usable state and then a
   payload phase. The payload can provide/implement many different
   functionalities including media and file system drivers, operating
   system boot, diagnostics, etc.

   While certain system firmware implementations implement both the
   initialization and OS boot logic in a single code base, the
   distinction lies in the functionality provided.

   This specification describes an interface between the
   bootloader phase that initializes the system hardware and the payload
   phase. It includes how to pass parameters to the payload and parameter
   format, payload image format, payload boot mode and stack usage, etc.
   The intent for this specification is to provide interoperability
   between spec compliant bootloaders and spec compliant payloads.

.. _bootloaders:

Bootloaders
-----------

   Bootloaders are primarily responsible for initializing the system
   hardware including, but not limited to CPU initialization, memory
   detection and initialization, initialization of silicon functional
   units (IO controllers), bus topology configuration, etc. In addition
   to the initialization itself, bootloader is responsible for providing
   the system configuration information to the subsequent stages in the
   boot process. In addition to proprietary options, there are many open
   sourced bootloaders available.

   **EDK II**

   TianoCore EDK II is a modern feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development
   environment for the UEFI and UEFI Platform Initialization (PI)
   specifications. EDKII performs both first stage (hardware
   initialization) and second stage booting.

   Reference implementations for many platforms are also available in
   open source, under BSD + Patents license.

   https://www.tianocore.org/

   **Slim Bootloader**

   Slim Bootloader is an open source system firmware implementation that
   adopts the modular initialization followed by payload launch approach
   of system firmware design. Slim Bootloader provides both the
   initialization phase and OsLoader payload, and it also
   supports launching of different payloads. Open source Slim Bootloader
   uses a BSD + Patents License.

   https://slimbootloader.github.io/

   **coreboot**

   Coreboot is a project to develop open source boot firmware for
   various architectures. It follows the design philosophy of minimum
   necessary initialization followed by payload. Coreboot is released
   under GNU's General Public License (GPL).

   https://www.coreboot.org/

   **U-Boot**

   U-Boot is an open-source, primary boot loader used in embedded
   devices. U-Boot performs both first stage (hardware initialization)
   and second stage booting. U-boot is released under GNU's General
   Public License (GPL)

   https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/WebHome


.. _payloads:

Payloads
--------

   After initializing the system hardware, bootloaders launch the
   payload modules. Payloads ideally are modular and platform
   independent. Payloads depend on abstract interfaces (scope of
   this document) to be platform independent.

   While OS boot protocol is one of the main functionalities provided by
   payloads, there could be other functionalities such as diagnostics 
   that can be enabled by payloads.

   From a design point of view, a payload is different from a boot image
   based on its relationship with the system firmware. Payloads are
   considered part of system firmware and are typically in flash memory, 
   while boot images are not considered part of system firmware (not
   within the trusted firmware boundary) and are often in separate boot media.

   As mentioned earlier, while certain system firmware
   implementations include both the initialization and OS boot logic
   in a single code base, the distinction lies in the functionality
   provided. This leads to use cases where some system firmware
   implementations can act as a payload providing OS boot capability, 
   while relying on an underlying bootloader layer for system hardware
   initialization. Examples of such payloads include TianoCore EDKII and U-boot.
   Both EDKII and uboot implementations include both phases of system
   firmware functionality, and can also be launched as payloads by other
   bootloaders.

   There are many payloads currently available, including the EDK II payload, 
   that provide UEFI services, Linux as a payload, u-boot payload and other
   custom implementations.

   **EDK II Payload**

   EDK II DXE and BDS stages can be launched by bootloaders as a UEFI
   payload. The EDK II payload provides the required UEFI specification
   defined architectural protocols, and can launch a UEFI aware OS.

   **SBL OsLoader**

   This is an SBL payload implementation that supports the Linux boot protocol, and
   can also launch ELF or PE executables. It also supports launching an OS
   compliant with the Multi-Boot specification.

   **Linux Payload**

   LinuxBoot is firmware for modern servers that replaces specific
   firmware functionality, like the UEFI DXE phase with a Linux kernel
   and runtime.

   https://www.linuxboot.org/

   **VaultBoot Payload**
   VaultBoot is a firmware security payload highly focus on trusted computing 
   and advanced defense, e.g: Verified boot (also known as Secure Boot) and 
   measured boot, TPMv2 based FDE (Full-disk encryption), local/remote 
   attestation, built-in DH key exchange against physical attack such as TPM Genie.

Bootloader Interfaces
----------------------


Coreboot Payload Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Reference**: https://www.coreboot.org/API

   **Reference**: https://doc.coreboot.org/lib/abi-data-consumption.html

   **Reference**:
   https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiPayloadPkg/Library/CbParseLib/CbParseLib.c

   Coreboot passes information to downstream users (payloads and/or
   operating systems) using **coreboot tables**.

   The table usually sits in memory around address 0x500. However, some
   bootloaders seem to overwrite low memory area, thus destroying the
   coreboot table integrity, rendering the table useless. So, the
   coreboot tables were moved to the high tables area.

   When coreboot tables were moved to high memory, a 40 bytes mini
   coreboot table with a single sub table is placed at 0x500/0x530 that
   points to the real coreboot table. This is comparable to the ACPI
   RSDT or the MP floating table.

   Coreboot tables contain a series of data records packed back to back, with
   each encoding both type and size. This is something similar to a UEFI
   HOB list. Coreboot tables provide information about: 

   -  **memory map**

   -  **Graphics Info**

   -  Pointers to certain CBMEM structures, such as **ACPI, SMBIOS**, etc. 


Slim Bootloader (SBL) Payload Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Reference**:
   https://slimbootloader.github.io/developer-guides/payload.html

   **Reference**:
   https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/PI_Spec_1_7_final_Jan_2019.pdf

   **Reference**:
   https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiPayloadPkg/Library/SblParseLib/SblParseLib.c

   SBL supports 'loosely coupled payload' which basically refers to
   payloads built independently (no source sharing). SBL builds a series
   of data structures called the Hand Off Blocks (HOBs) and provides a
   pointer to this HOB List to the payloads. These data structures
   conform to the HOB format as described in the Platform Initialization
   (PI) Specification.


PEI to DXE Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Reference**:
   https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/PI_Spec_1_7_final_Jan_2019.pdf

   PEI must also provide a mechanism for components of DXE and the DXE
   Foundation to discover the state of the system when the DXE
   Foundation is invoked. Certain aspects of the system state at handoff
   are architectural, while other system state information may vary and
   hence must be described to DXE components.

   The DXE IPL PPI passes the Hand-Off Block (HOB) list from PEI to the
   DXE Foundation when it invokes the DXE Foundation. The handoff state
   is described in the form of HOBs in the HOB list.

.. _os-interfaces:

OS interfaces
-------------

   While this specification aims to document the bootloader to payload
   interface, the payload to OS interface is briefly discussed just for
   the sake of completeness.


OS Boot protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **UEFI**

   UEFI stands for "Unified Extensible Firmware Interface." The UEFI
   Specification defines a new model for the interface between
   personal-computer operating systems and platform firmware. The
   interface consists of data tables that contain platform-related
   information, plus boot and runtime service calls that are available
   to the operating system and its loader. Together, these provide a
   standard environment for booting an operating system and running
   pre-boot applications.

   https://uefi.org/specifications

   **Linux Boot Protocol**

   Linux kernel can itself be a bootable image without needing a
   separate OS Loader. The Linux boot protocol defines the requirements
   required to launch Linux kernel as a boot target.

   https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/boot.html

   **Multiboot Protocol**

   The Multiboot specification is an open standard describing how a boot
   loader can load an x86 operating system kernel. The specification
   allows any compliant boot-loader implementation to boot any compliant
   operating-system kernel. Thus, it allows different operating systems
   and boot loaders to work together and interoperate, without the need
   for operating system specific boot loaders.

   https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot2/multiboot.html


Data interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Modern computer buses and devices such as PCI, PCIe, USB, and SATA support
   software detection, enumeration and configuration, providing true
   plug and play capabilities. However, there still exists some devices that are
   not enumerable through software.

   Examples:

   -  PCI Host Bridge

   -  GPIO

   -  Serial interfaces like I2C, HS-UART, etc.

   -  Graphics framebuffer

   -  Device Management information including manufacturer name, etc.

   While it is possible to write platform specific device drivers to
   support such devices/interfaces, it is efficient for the platform
   specific firmware to provide information to the platform independent
   operating system.

   There are two data protocols that are used extensively for this
   purpose: ACPI and Device Tree.

   **ACPI**

   Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (**ACPI**) provides an
   open standard that operating systems can use to discover and
   configure computer hardware components, to perform power management
   by (for example) putting unused components to sleep, and to perform
   status monitoring. In October 2013, ACPI Special Interest Group (ACPI
   SIG), the original developers of the ACPI standard, agreed to
   transfer all assets to the UEFI Forum, in which all future
   development will take place.

   **SMBIOS**

   System Management BIOS (**SMBIOS**) is the premier standard for
   delivering management information via system firmware.

   https://uefi.org/specifications

   https://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios

   **DEVICE TREE**

   The devicetree is a data structure for describing hardware. A
   devicetree is a tree data structure with nodes that describe the
   devices in a system. Each node has property/value pairs that describe
   the characteristics of the device being represented.

   https://www.devicetree.org/

Payload principle
-----------------

   | Keep interface as clean and simple as possible.
   | The payload should encapsulate the boot abstractions for a given
     technology, such as UEFI payload or LinuxBoot. The Payload should
     vie to be portable to different platform implementations (PI), such
     as coreboot, Slim bootloader, or an EDKII style firmware.
   | The payload should elide strong dependencies on the payload
     launching code (e.g., coreboot versus EDKII versus slimboot) and
     also avoid board-specific dependencies. The payload behavior should
     be parameterized by the data input block.

   | **Open**\ *: Should Payload return back to bootloader if payload
     fail?*
   | *Answer: No for first generation. No callbacks into payload
     launcher.*

   **Open**\ *: Do we need callback from payload to bootloader? Avoid it
   if possible*

   | **Open**\ *: How to support SMM for booloader and Payload? Where is
     trust boundary.*
   | *Answer: SMM should be either part of the payload for present
     generation Management Mode (MM) PI drivers, but longer term the
     EDKII PI independent MM modules should be used. The latter are a
     class of SMM drivers (or TrustZone drivers for ARM) that are not
     launched via DXE. For coreboot SMM can be loaded from ramstage, the
     PI payload launcher, or elided from ramstage and use the portable
     MM handlers.*
   | If there is an existing standard it will be used (e.g., ACPI table
     that is simple to parse).

Security
--------

Payload is part of system firmware TCB

   Today the payload is provisioned as part of the platform
   initialization code. As such, the payload is protected and updated by
   the platform manufacturer (PM). The payload should be covered by a
   digital signature generated by the PM. The platform owner (PO) should
   not be able to update the payload independently of the PM.

   | The platform initialization (PI) code should be the platform root
     of trust for update, measurement, and verification. As such, the PI
     code that launches the payload should verify the payload using
     payload Hash or using a key to verify its signature. The PI code
     should also provide a measurement into a Trusted Platform Module
     (TPM) of the payload into a TPM Platform Configuration Register
     (e.g., PCR[0]). The payload may continue the measured boot actions
     by recording code executed in the payload phase into PCRs (e.g.,
     UEFI driver into PCR[2], UEFI OS loader into PCR[4]).
   | *Open: Do we need a capability boot to say if payload
     supports/requires measured/verified boot?*


Payload Image Format
-----------------------

Payload, as a standalone component, usually needs to be loaded by a
bootloader into memory properly prior to execution. In this loading
process, additional process might be required, such as assembling,
rebasing, authenticating, etc. Today, many payloads use
their own image formats (PE, ELF, FV, RAW, etc.), and it is very
challenging for a bootloader to identify and support all of them.  

To address this, a common payload image format is desired to
facilitate the payload loading process. Instead of defining a new
image format for payloads, it is preferred to reuse an already-existing
format, such as ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) and PE (Portable
Executable). This specification selects the ELF image format as the
common universal payload image format since it is is flexible, extensible,
and cross-platform. It is also adopted by many different operating systems
on many different hardware platforms.

For detailed information on the ELF image format, please see
`ELF Specification <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/elf.pdf>`_ .


Payload Image Sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use ELF image as universal payload image format, it is required to define
a simple way for bootloader to differenciate a universal payload image from
a regular ELF image. On the other side, a universal payload might aslo need
addtional image information to proceed with the boot flow. This specifciation
requires the universal payload image to provide these addtional requried
inforamtion through new defined ELF sections, *Universal Payload Information
Section* and *Universal Payload Loaded Image Section*.


Universal Payload Information Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This specification requires a mandatory ELF universal payload information section
to indicate the ELF image conforms to this specification. If this section is found
inside the ELF image and is valid, the bootloader can retrieve universal payload
specific information from this section, such as payload version, payload ID, etc.
And the bootloader shall use the interfaces defined in this specification to handoff
the control to the payload.

This Universal Payload Information section must:

-  Have section name defined as ".upld_info"

-  Have section aligned at 4-byte boundary within the ELF image.

-  Contain UNIVERSAL_PAYLOAD_INFO structure in its section, as
   defined as below:

Universal Payload Loaded Image Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many cases that a payload might need extra images to proceed the
boot flow. For example, UEFI payload might need additional FV images, Linux
payload might need additional InitRd image, u-boot might need additional
device tree blob, etc. In these cases, it is desired to pass this additional
image information from bootloader to payload so that payload can consume these
images later.

This specification defines optional universal payload extra image sections. 
If exist, they holds extra image information to be passed into the universal
payload. Please note, multiple extra image sections might exist in single
universal payload ELF image.

If an universal payload extra image section needs to be provided, it
must:

-  Have unique section name defined as ".upld.*". The full section name string
   length needs to be less than 16. Here, ‘*’ can be any ASCII string.

-  Have section aligned at proper boundary within the ELF file as required by
   the nature of the extra image itself. For example, FV and InitRd might need
   4KB page-aligned.

-  Contain the raw extra image data in its section.

During payload image loading, the bootloader shall build these extra images into
HOB. And the universal payload can locate the information from the HOB and find
required extra image information for consumption. 


Hand-off state
----------------

The bootloader builds the Hand-Off Block (HOB) list containing
platform specific information and passes the address of the HOB list
to the payload.

The prototype of payload entry point is defined as::

  typedef
  VOID
  (*PAYLOAD_ENTRY) (
    EFI_HOB_HANDOFF_INFO_TABLE *HobList
  );

The compiler need use a proper attributes for this function to meet the calling convention below.
For example, Microsoft Visual studio uses __cdecl for X64, while Linux GCC uses __attribute__((ms_abi)) for X64.

HOB List defines the detailed HOB list being used to transfer
platform specific data from the bootloader to the payload.

IA-32 and x64 Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

State of silicon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The bootloader initializes the processor and chipset through
   vendor-specific silicon initialization implementation. For example,
   FSP is a binary form of Intel silicon initialization implementation.
   Typically, when the control transfers to the payload:

-  The memory controller is initialized such that physical memory is
   available to use.

-  Processors (including application processors) are patched with
   microcode and initialized properly.

-  The PCI bus is assigned with proper bus numbers, IO/MMIO space.

-  The Graphics controller may be initialized properly.

..

   But the bootloader could do less silicon initialization if the
   responsibilities of the payload and the bootloader are well defined
   (out of the scope of this document).

Instruction execution environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Regardless of the environment where the bootloader runs, the
   processor is in 32bit protected mode when a 32bit payload starts, or
   in 64bit long-mode when a 64bit payload starts. The payload header
   contains the machine type information that the payload supports.

   The following sections provide a detailed description of the
   execution environment when the payload starts.

Registers
%%%%%%%%%%%

-  ESP + 4 points to the address of the HOB list for the 32bit payload.

-  RCX holds the address of the HOB list for the 64bit payload.

-  Direction flag in EFLAGs is clear so the string instructions process
   from low addresses to high addresses.

-  All other general-purpose register states are undefined.

-  Floating-point control word is initialized to 0x027F (all exceptions
   masked, double-precision, round-to-nearest).

-  | Multimedia-extensions control word (if supported) is initialized to
     0x1F80 (all exceptions
   | masked, round-to-nearest, flush to zero for masked underflow).

-  CR0.EM is clear.

-  CR0.TS is clear.

Interrupt
%%%%%%%%%%%

   Interrupt is disabled. The hardware is initialized by the boot loader
   such that no interrupt triggers even when the payload sets the
   Interrupt Enable flag in EFLAGs.

Page table
%%%%%%%%%%%%

   Selectors are set to be flat.

   Paging mode may be enabled for the 32bit payload. (have general term
   on how it could be enabled if enabling page mode).

   Paging mode is enabled for the 64bit payload.

   When paging is enabled, all memory space is identity mapped (virtual
   address equals physical address). The four-level page table is set
   up. The payload can choose to set up the five-level page table as
   needed.

Stack
%%%%%%%

   4KiB stack is available for the payload. The stack is 16-byte aligned
   and may be marked as non-executable in page table.

   discussion: Should payload declare its required stack size in the
   payload header?

   Payload could setup its own stack, there is no restriction to setup a
   new stack.

Application processors
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

   Payload starts on the bootstrap processor. All application processors
   (on a multiple-processor system) are in halt state.

   Use mWait and mBox to wake up. (Follow ACPI table). How about the
   legacy bootloader? Assume something if ACPI is not there.

   TODO: take care about virtual platforms.

ARM Platforms

RISC-V Platforms

Payload Interfaces
--------------------

The bootloader provides platform information to payload through
standard ACPI table, SMBIOS table, Device tree and a series of data
structures called the Hand Off Blocks (HOBs). If the information is
already defined in ACPI specification, SMBIOS specification or device
tree, the payload could parse them to get the required information.
For the platform information that is not defined in the standard
tables, the bootloader should build a HOB list to pass it to the
payload.

Open: Do we need a set of configuration data to config payload?

  We do not believe so.

Open: Do we need pass data from payload to bootloader to impact bootloader behavior in next boot?

  Keep it open now.

Open: will payload be run in S3 path?

  Suggest skipping payload.

.. _acpi_tables:

ACPI tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ACPI table is required to boot modern operation system, especially to boot windows operating system.
The bootloader should provide a ACPI RSDP HOB. In the ACPI table least RSDT, FADT and MCFG should be available to the payload.
Payload could remove/add/modify the ACPI table passed from the bootloader if required.

The payload could parse the ACPI table to get some basic platform
information. For example, the Fixed ACPI Description Table (FADT)
defines various fixed hardware ACPI information to an ACPI compatible
OS, such as the base address for the following hardware registers
blocks: PM1a_CNT_BLK, PM_TMR_BLK, PM1a_EVT_BLK, GPE0_BLK,
PM1b_EVT_BLK, PM1b_CNT_BLK, PM2_CNT_BLK, and GPE1_BLK. The payload
could use them and other values (e.g. RESET_REG, RESET_VALUE) to make
the payload platform independent.

The other example is to get PCIE base address from ACPI memory mapped
configuration space access table definition, defined in the PCI
Firmware Specification.
`http://www.pcisig.com <http://www.pcisig.com/>`.

And another example is on the debug device info. The bootloader might
report debug device following up ACPI Debug Port Table 2 (DBG2). If a
fully 16550-compatible serial device is specified in the ACPI DBG2,
bootloader should provide a Serial Debug Information HOB in the HOB
list so that the payload could use same debug device with same
setting. If the ACPI DBG2 table could not be found, the payload
should use serial device provided by the Serial Debug Information HOB
as the default debug device.

.. hob_list:

HOB List
~~~~~~~~~~

The bootloader should build a HOB list and pass the HOB list header
to payload when passing control to payload. The HOB format is
described in the *Platform Initialization (PI) Specification - Volume
3: Shared Architectural Elements*.

There are two sections below describing the HOBs produced by the
bootloader and consumed by the payload for providing the system
architecturally information.

First section describes the HOBs defined in *Platform Initialization
Specification Volume 3: Shared Architectural elements*.

Second section defines the new HOBs.

Reusing Interfaces in Platform Initialization Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PHIT(Phase Handoff Info Table) HOB
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The bootloader should report the general state information through
the HOB following EFI_HOB_HANDOFF_INFO_TABLE format defined in
*Platform Initialization Specification Volume 3: Shared Architectural
elements*.

CPU HOB
%%%%%%%%%

The bootloader should report the processor information including address space
and I/O space capabilities to the payload through the HOB following
EFI_HOB_CPU format defined in *Platform Initialization Specification Volume 3:
Shared Architectural elements*.

Resource Descriptor HOB
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The bootloader should report the system resources through the HOB
following EFI_HOB_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR format defined in *Platform
Initialization Specification Volume 3: Shared Architectural
elements*.

For example, any physical memory found in bootloader should be
reported using resource type EFI_RESOURCE_SYSTEM_MEMORY, and the
reserved memory used by bootloader should be reported using resource
type EFI_RESOURCE_MEMORY_RESERVED.

I/O and memory mapped I/O resource should also be reported using
resource type EFI_RESOURCE_IO and EFI_RESOURCE_MEMORY_MAPPED_IO.

Memory Allocation HOB
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The bootloader should report the memory usages that exist outside the
HOB list through the HOB following EFI_HOB_MEMORY_ALLOCATION format defined
in *Platform Initialization Specification Volume 3: Shared Architectural
elements*.

Boot-Strap Processor (BSP) Stack Memory Allocation HOB
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

The bootloader should report the initial stack prepared for payload through
the HOB following EFI_HOB_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_STACK format defined in *Platform
Initialization Specification Volume 3: Shared Architectural elements*.

Memory Allocation Module HOB
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

The bootloader should report the payload memory location and entry point
through the HOB following EFI_HOB_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_MODULE format defined
in *Platform Initialization Specification Volume 3: Shared Architectural
elements*.

Graphics information HOB
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If bootloader initializes the graphics device, the bootloader might
report graphics mode and framebuffer information through
EFI_PEI_GRAPHICS_INFO_HOB, and graphics hardware information
through EFI_PEI_GRAPHICS_DEVICE_INFO_HOB.

EFI_PEI_GRAPHICS_INFO_HOB and EFI_PEI_GRAPHICS_DEVICE_INFO_HOB provide the basic information
for the graphics display. These HOBs are described in the *PI Specification.*

Please refer Appendix 6.6 EFI_PEI_GRAPHICS_INFO_HOB and 6.7 EFI_PEI_GRAPHICS_DEVICE_INFO_HOB for the details.

New Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Common Payload Header
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

All new interfaces are GUID type HOBs starting with ``EFI_HOB_GUID_TYPE`` defined in the PI Specification.

The HOB data starts with a common header defined as below::

  #pragma pack(1)
  
  typedef struct {
    UINT8                Revision;
    UINT8                Reserved;
    UINT16               Length;
  } UNIVERSAL_PAYLOAD_GENERIC_HEADER;

  #pragma pack()

``Revision``

It doesn't increase when new members are appended to the end of the interface.

It increases by one when existing members are renamed or re-interpreted for different purposes.

``Length``

The Length equals to the sizeof (UNIVERSAL_PAYLOAD_GENERIC_HEADER) + sizeof (<additional members>).

Consumers of the interfaces should only access those members that are covered by Length.

.. note::
  ``EFI_HOB_GUID_TYPE`` contains a Length field to tell the actual bytes the whole HOB data occupies.

  It also includes the optional padding bytes to make sure each HOB is multiple of 8 bytes in length.

  ``UNIVERSAL_PAYLOAD_GENERIC_HEADER.Length`` tells the exact length of the meaningful data excluding the padding bytes.
  So, it's always true that ``UNIVERSAL_PAYLOAD_GENERIC_HEADER.Length`` is less than or equal to the Length in ``EFI_HOB_GUID_TYPE``.

HOB data for different interfaces is defined in following sections.

Optional Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some more HOBs could be built by bootloaders for advanced features. e.g.:

  Support FVs (also other format) from bootloader to payload

  Add debug log as HOB to payload

**Opens**: Does the bootloader need report IO info to payload?

      Better let the bootloader to report it,

**Opens**: does the HOB List need a checksum?

      It looks not too much value. Keep it open if we really need it.

**Opens**: For some information it is already in ACPI table, should bootloader build HOB for same info?

      Payload could have a check to ACPI table to get basic info they need.

corresponding color. Bits in *RedMask*, *GreenMask*, *BlueMask*, and *ReserverdMask* must not overlap bit

**NOTE:** for performance reasons, or due to hardware restrictions,
scan lines may be padded to an amount of memory alignment. These
padding pixel elements are outside the area covered by
*HorizontalResolution* and are not visible. For direct frame buffer
access, this number is used as a span between starts of pixel lines
in video memory. Based on the size of an individual pixel element and
*PixelsPerScanline*, the offset in video memory from pixel element
(x, y) to pixel element (x, y+1) has to be calculated as "sizeof(
PixelElement ) \* PixelsPerScanLine", not "sizeof( PixelElement ) \*
HorizontalResolution", though in many cases those values can
coincide. This value can depend on video hardware and mode
resolution. GOP implementation is responsible for providing accurate
value for this field.

Future Interface
----------------------

Currently, we are using HobList as Universal Payload Interface. However, Hoblist has some limitations as below:

1)	Hob is an implementation of Edk2, and defined in PI spec. This may be not friendly to non-Edk2 developers.

2)	Some hob structures contain fields which are only meaningful for Edk2 DXE phase. These fields are confusing.

3)	Hob can contain not only the data transferred to the next phase but also the data used in the current phase. There is no clear boundary of them.

4)	Not a self-describing data format.

In the future, we plan to use another data format CBOR to replace Hob.

CBOR encoded data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bootloader should build a CBOR encoded data and pass the CBOR encoded data header
to payload when passing control to payload.
Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a binary data serialization Json-like
format defined in the https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html

To be self-describing, the CBOR encoded data itself is a CBOR map type containing
<Key, Value> pairs. The map is called CBOR root map in this document.
Some of the values called basic type is directly stored into the root map, and the
key and value type are stored in key and type column of the below table.
Some of the values called special type need to be stores in a submap of an array,
because there may be multiple instances of the values. For these kinds of value,
The key for array is stores in the key column, and the key and type for the value
are stored in in Submap key and type column. For example, the value in root map
with key “UplExtraData” is a CBOR format array, and the array contains one or more elements.
Each element is a CBOR format map, and contains some <Key, value> pairs, and the Key can
be "Identifier", "Base" and "Size" according to the below table.

The below table shows what information can be contained in CBOR encoded data. 

**Fields inside CBOR encoded data**

Because CBOR has different types compared with C language, the below table lists the C type and CBOR type for each field.
For example, we have UINT8, UINT32, UINT64 in C language for unsigned integer, but in CBOR type, Unsigned Integer can cover all
unsigned integer from 0 to 2^64 - 1.

Hand-off state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bootloader builds the CBOR encoded data containing platform specific information
and passes the address of the the CBOR encoded data to the payload.

The prototype of payload entry point is defined as::

  typedef
  VOID
  (*PAYLOAD_ENTRY) (
    VOID * CobrEncodedData
  );

The compiler need use a proper attributes for this function to meet the calling convention below.
For example, Microsoft Visual studio uses __cdecl for X64, while Linux GCC uses __attribute__((ms_abi)) for X64.

CobrEncodedData is a pointer pointing to a CBOR encoded data which is a CBOR map containing information from above section.
